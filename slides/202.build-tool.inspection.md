Nix Build Tool: Inspector Derivation
===

```sh
$ nix derivation show /nix/store/<hash>-hello-script.drv
{
  "/nix/store/<hash>-hello-script.drv": {
    ...
    "env": {
      "builder": "/nix/store/<hash>-bash-5.2p37/bin/bash",
      "out": "/nix/store/<hash>-hello-script",
      "src": "/nix/store/<hash>-hello.sh",
      ...
    },
    "inputDrvs": {
      "/nix/store/<hash>-coreutils-9.5.drv": {...},
      "/nix/store/<hash>-bash-5.2p37.drv": {...}
    },
    "inputSrcs": [
      "/nix/store/<hash>-hello.sh"
    ],
    "outputs": {
      "out": {
        "path": "/nix/store/<hash>-hello-script"
      }
    },
  }
}
```

<!--
speaker_note: |
  now that we have that build derivation, let's inspect it with the `nix show-derivation` command

  it'll output a large json blob, but the things we care about can be seen here

  you can see the environment variables the builder had access to - note that src points to a nix store file

  we can also see a list of input derivations, including both coreutils and bash since those were our dependencies

  we also have our input and output paths in the nix store

  $ nix derivation show /nix/store/v2c3an36isshk60q04d377h8j2acn4ns-hello-script.drv
