Nix Build Tool: Flakes
===

<!-- pause -->

You can declare multiple packages in your flake.

Non-default packages can be referenced with the format: `<path-to-flake>#<package-name>`.
So if instead of `default` in your flake output, you had `hello`, you woud run:

```sh
$ nix build .#hello
```

<!-- column: 0 -->

There are lots of output properties on a flake. Notable ones include:

```nix
{
  # ...
  packages.aarch64-darwin.mypkg = derivation;
  apps.aarch64-darwin.myapp = {
    type = "app";
    program = "<store-path>";
  };
  devShells.aarch64-darwin.myshell = derivation;
  # ...
}
```

<!-- column: 1 -->

```sh
$ nix build .#mypkg
```

```sh
$ nix run .#myapp
```

```sh
$ nix develop .#myshell
```

speaker_note: |
  there are some more advanced things you can do with flakes
  you can have multiple packages defined in your flake
  =====
  if you declare an output with a non-default name, you can reference it with the pound sign
  this is done by specifying the path to the flake, the pound symbol, and then the name of the output
  =====
  there are also lots of other output types you can declare on a flake
  listed here are some of the more common ones

  packages declare derivations that will be built with nix build

  apps are things that will be run with `nix run`

  dev shells allow you to declare a development environment with all of the dependencies you need
  the `nix develop` command will create a shell that'll have everything declared in the dev shell in it

  there are other flake outputs to declare things like formatters, nixosconfigurations for nixos, and flake templates
