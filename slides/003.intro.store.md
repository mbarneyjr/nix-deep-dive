What is Nix?: Nix Store
===

All software builds and downloads happen in the nix store.

<!-- column_layout: [2, 1] -->

<!-- column: 0 -->

Components:

- hash: a hash of the build inputs (`abc123`)
  - compiler, build command, flags, etc
- name: the package name (`nodejs`)
- version: the package version (`22.14.0`)

<!-- column: 1 -->

```sh
$ ls /nix/store
<hash>-<name>-<version>
abc123-nodejs-22.14.0
```

<!-- reset_layout -->

<!-- pause -->

Multiple versions of the same package can be used at the same time for a build.

Every reference uses the hash.

For instance, if you've bulit the `hello` package before/after an update:

```sh
/nix/store/abc123-hello-2.12
/nix/store/def456-hello-2.10
```

Projects that used `hello-2.10` would continue to function just fine.

speaker_note: |
  any time nix builds software, it puts it in the /nix/store volume

  =====

  all /nix/store directories have a hash, name, and version
  the hash is a hash of all build inputs: the compiler, compiler flags, dependencies, etc
  if anything changes with that build recipe, you'll get a new build directory

  =====

  since everything is hashed you could have two versions of the same package and they wouldn't interfere
  in this example, we can have hello built with two different versions in two separate directories
  packages that rely on the 2.10 version can continue to function with packages that need 2.12
