Nix Build Tool: Derivations
===

<!-- column_layout: [3, 2] -->

<!-- column: 0 -->

Let's write a derivation!
It's done using the built-in `derivation` function:

<!-- pause -->

```file
path: ./examples/derivation/derivation.nix
language: nix
```

<!-- pause -->

<!-- column: 1 -->

We need `nixpkgs` `coreutils` to get access to `mkdir`, `cp`, `chmod`, etc.

<!-- pause -->

`derivation` is a nix function that declares a derivation, which requires:

- `name`: identifies the output
- `system`: cpu architecture + os
- `builder`: the path to the thing that executes the build

<!-- pause -->

These are optional arguments to `derivation`:

- `args`: a list of arguments passed to the builder

<!-- pause -->

Other arguments are available as environment variables.
`$out` is always the output directory.

speaker_note: |
  now that we understand a little of the why, let's build a derivation
  =====
  this example is one of the simplest derivations you can create
  what we're really doing is creating a hello world bash script
  to create a derivation, you call the built-in `derivation` function
  there are higher-level abstractions for building things like go packages, or rust packages, or python/node packages
  but for now, we're keeping it simple
  =====
  any references within the derivation call are now dependencies, like `coreutils`
  =====
  the derivation function has 3 required arguments: `name`, `system`, and `builder`
  the `name` is the name of the derivation, which is used to identify the output
  the `system` specifies the system type for which the derivation is built, like arm vs x86 and linux vs darwin
  builder is the path to the shell or script that will execute the build instructions
  in our case, we're calling bash from nixpkgs as our builder script
  without nixpkgs, we don't have bash unless we include a copy of it in our project
  =====
  we also have an optional `args` argument, which is the list of arguments to pass to the builder
  you can see we have to import `coreutils` to have access to things we take for granted like mkdir, cp, and chmod
  =====
  all other arguments are included as environment variables
  any argument that is a path has its nix store path set as an environment variable in the builder
  one default environment variable that's avialable in all derivations is `$out`
  out defines the place you should write your derivation outputs to
  in this case, you can see we're copying $src, which is our local bash script, into `$out/bin/hello`
