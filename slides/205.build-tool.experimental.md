Nix Build Tool: Experimental?
===

<!-- pause -->

## "Experimental" Features

- There are two primary ways to use Nix: with or without Nix "Flakes".
- Flakes require two `experimental` features: "flakes" and "nix command".
- These features are pragmatically stable.
- Flakes should be used for new projects/use-cases.

### Flakes

- Flakes are a new way to create packages for Nix code.
- `flake.nix` and `flake.lock`
- They pin all dependencies so they are more reproducible.
- Previous Nix expressions used "channels", a global reference to nixpkgs, no locking.

### Nix Command

- Previously, Nix had many different commands, now it has a unified CLI.
- `nix-build` is now `nix build`.

speaker_note: |
  nix can be confusing for new people learning it
  =====
  one of the reasons why is a couple of experimental features
  pragmatically they've been stable for years
  most of the community is using them
  but you may see that guidance is pretty bifurcated between two approaches
  make sure you're finding recent documentation
  =====
  starting with flakes, they're repositories with a flake.nix file
  the flake.nix file defines the specific version of nixpkgs to use, and locks it within flake.lock
  this locking is specific to the flake, not the system you're running on
  before you'd have something called a "channel", which is like a global instance of nixpkgs
  if you needed a more up-to-date version of something for one package, you'd update that channel
  updating the channel updates the nixpkgs reference across your whole machine though
  so you could break the reproducibility of nix that way
  flakes now tie the nixpkgs reference to the flake itself, and it'll be locked in a lock file
  =====
  the modern approach unifies a lot of commands under a single `nix` command
  what was once `nix-build` is now `nix build`
  interacting with flakes requires the unified nix cli
