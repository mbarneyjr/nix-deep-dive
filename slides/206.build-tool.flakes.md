Nix Build Tool: Flakes
===

<!-- pause -->

A flake is a way to package code in a reproducible and discoverable way.
To create a flake, add a `flake.nix` file to your directory.

`flake.nix` defines the derivation used to build your application.
It can also define other things, like the development environment used to build your app.

The following is a basic flake example for building a Go executable:

```nix
{
  description = "A very basic flake";
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:nixos/nixpkgs?ref=nixos-unstable";
  };
  outputs = { self, nixpkgs }: let
    pkgs = import nixpkgs { system = "aarch64-darwin"; };
  in {
    packages.aarch64-darwin.default = pkgs.buildGoModule {
      pname = "go-example";
      version = "0.0.0";
      src = ./.;
      vendorHash = null;
    };
  };
}
```

  now what if we wanted to use the modern approach to build an app?
  let's dig into flakes
  =====
  a flake is a way to package code in a reproducible and discoverable way
  any directory with a `flake.nix` file is a flake
  the flake should be an expression that results in an attribute set that must follow a specific schema
  at the root of the attribute set there is a description, inputs, and outputs

  inputs declare the dependencies of the flake
  you can see in this example that we're defining nixpkgs to be a dependency of this flake from github
  you can also include other flakes as inputs to your flake
  when the flake is evaluated for the first time, a lock file will be created that pins all inputs
  any future operations on the flake will use those exact same inputs, even if there's an update upstream

  flake `outputs` is a function that gets called with all of the flake inputs
  it's also called with `self`, which is a reference to the flake itself, like class methods in python

  the resulting attribute set can have multiple properties
  but in this case we're returning a default package
  packages define the actual derivation of the flake when it's built or used
  flake outputs usually have a name, but by default the `default` output will be used
