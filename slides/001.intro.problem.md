  what does nix do for us?

  solves the "works on my machine" problem

  replaces package managers like Brew or apt
  nixpkgs is the largest repository

  defining your per-project development environment
  makes sure necessary tools are available for development
  increases parity between local dev, build, and production environments

  personal system bootstrapping
  used to have a bash script to install brew, set settings, configure python
  now everything is defined within my nix config
  and i can take that to my personal computer, or even Amazon Workspaces
  onboarding new environments to have everything I use is much quicker
