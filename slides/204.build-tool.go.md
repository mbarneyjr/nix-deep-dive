Nix Build Tool: Golang
===

Nixpkgs is more than a repository, it's also the Nix language's standard library.

If you had a simple go app, here's how you'd build it with Nix:

<!-- column_layout: [1, 1] -->

<!-- column: 0 -->

```go
// main.go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Hello, Nix!")
}
```

<!-- column: 1 -->

```nix
# derivation.nix
let
  pkgs = import <nixpkgs> {};
in
  pkgs.buildGoModule {
    pname = "go-example";
    version = "0.0.0";
    src = ./.;
    vendorHash = null;
  }
```

<!-- reset_layout -->

```sh
$ nix build -f ./derivation.nix
...
$ ./result/bin/gonix
Hello, Nix!
```

<!--
speaker_note: |
  we probably don't want to be using the lower-level `derivation` function for everything
  nixpkgs is a standard library for the nix language, that includes higher level derivation builders
  =====
  what would it look like to build a go package in the real world?
  in this example, we're using the `pkgs.buildgomodule` function to define our derivation
  we give it a src directory, name, and version, and it handles defining the derivation for you
