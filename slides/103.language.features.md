Nix Language: Other Features
===

There are some other syntactical features:

<!-- column_layout: [1, 1] -->

<!-- column: 0 -->

```sh
# let-in
let x = 1; in x + 1

# string interpolation
"hello ${name}"

# inherit
{ inherit a b; c = 3; }
# == { a = a; b = b; c = 3; }
```

<!-- column: 1 -->

```sh
# recursive attribute sets
rec { a = 1; b = a + 1; }

# with
let
  a = { x = 1; y = 2; };
in
  with a; x + y

# import
{ x = import ./file.nix; }

# NIX_PATH environment variable declares
# "channels", points to a nix file
import <nixpkgs>
```

<!--
speaker_note: |
  some other operators and syntactical features that are worth mentioning

  you can use the `let` keyword to declare local variables within the scope of the `in` keyword

  string interpolation is exactly how you'd expect in other languages

  the `inherit` keyword is shorthand for `a = a`, it's just `inherit a`

  recursive attribute sets are declared with the `rec` keyword
  recursive attribute sets allow you to reference other attributes in the same set

  the `with` keyword allows you to use the attributes of an attribute set without having specify the attribute set
  so in this example, we don't have to say `a.x` and `a.y`, we can just say `x` and `y`

  the `import` keyword is used to import other nix files
  the file is evaluated and the result is returned

  the `nix_path` environment variable is used to declare "lookup paths"
  it has key value pairs, where keys are the name you can import and value is a path to a nix file
  it's commonly used for nix's old "channel" feature, where the nixpkgs expression is imported from a git repository
