NixOS: Overview
===

Nix can configure entire systems.

<!-- pause -->

<!-- column_layout: [1, 1, 1] -->

<!-- column: 0 -->

## NixOS

Linux distribution: immutable, declarative, and reproducible:

- globally-installed packages
- desktop environments (gnome, i3, etc)
- system services (ssh, postgres, etc)
- security configuration (pam, etc)
- more!

<!-- pause -->

<!-- column: 1 -->

## Nix Darwin

Like NixOS, but configures macOS settings:

- globally-installed packages
- `launchd` services
- `defaults` (dock, key repeat, etc)
- `enableSudoTouchIdAuth`
- homebrew

<!-- pause -->

<!-- column: 2 -->
## Home Manager

Like NixOS but for your home directory:

- user-installed packages
- application configs (`~/.config/...`)
- arbitrary files

Useful for linux/WSL where you don't have NixOS installed.

Like nix profiles, these configs are versioned with generations.

speaker_note: |
  nix can configure entire systems, whether that's macos, regular linux distributions, or NixOS
  =====
  we'll start with NixOS
  the main idea is that everything is defined in a nix configuration
  everything from the kernel and drivers to the applications you want available for a given user is captured
  it's reproducible too, you can have configuration parity across multiple systems
  =====
  if you're using macOS, you can use nix-darwin
  it's the closest you'll get to a NixOS experience on macOS
  most macOS settings can be configured with the `defaults` utility, nix-darwin integrates with this
  you can even discover options by browsing the nix-darwin documentation
  that's how i discovered you can use touch id with sudo
  it can even manage homebrew-installed software, which I use for a lot of casks like Chrome
  =====
  and finally, if you're on a linux or WSL machine and want to manage what you can with Nix, there's home-manager
  home-manager allows you to configure the packages you want available to a given user
  it can also manage dotfiles and other per-user configuration
  home-manager is often also used with NixOS and nix-darwin
  =====
  all of these things are versioned and create generations for each change
  calling back to the previous slide, home-manager would be the preferred way to install packages
  this allows you to declaratively list the packages you need, rather than imperatively install them over time
