Nix Build Tool: Overlay Example
===

Overlays are functions with two arguments:
`final`, which is `nixpkgs` after any overlays have been applied, and
`prev`, which is `nixpkgs` without any modification.

You return from the function changes to nixpkgs that you'd like to make.
`overrideAttrs` patches derivation inputs.

<!-- column: 0 -->

```sh
# awsume.nix
final: prev: {
  awsume = prev.awsume.overrideAttrs (old: {
    src = prev.fetchFromGitHub {
      rev = "4.5.6.alpha";
      sha256 = "...";
    };
  });
}
```

<!-- column: 1 -->

```sh
let
  awsume-overlay = import ./awsume.nix;
  pkgs = import nixpkgs {
    system = "aarch64-darwin";
    overlays = [ awsume-overlay ];
  };
in
 pkgs.awsume;
```

<!-- reset_layout -->

For our use case, we want to override `src` on the `awsume` package.
You'll get the `sha256` value by either:

- use the `nix-prefetch-url` command.
- trying to build first and copying the expected value from the error message.

Now, your Flake's `nixpkgs` will have `awsume` with version `4.5.6.alpha` in it.

<!--
speaker_note: |
  an overlay at its core is a function that takes two arguments: `final` and `prev`
  `final` is the current state of the package set from all overlays previously applied
  `prev` is the previous state of the package set before this overlay has been applied
  the function should return the changes you want to make as an attribute set
  =====
  that attribute set gets merged with the result from importing nixpkgs
  to override `awsume`, specify an `awsume` property on that attribute set
  within the `awsume` attribute set, you can override any property you want

  note: you can see the source for any nixpkgs from the nixpkgs search page
  links to the specific file are included for every package, so you can know what your override will actually do
