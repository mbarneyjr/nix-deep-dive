  outputs = { nixpkgs }: {
    let pkgs = import nixpkgs {...}; in {
      devShells.aarch64-darwin.default =
        pkgs.mkShell {
          packages = [
            pkgs.presenterm
          ];
        }
    }
  };
}
```

```sh
$ type -a presenterm
presenterm not found
$ nix develop
$ type -a presenterm
