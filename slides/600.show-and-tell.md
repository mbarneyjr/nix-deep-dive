<!--
speaker_note: |
  to show a bit about what this all would look like, let's take a look at some examples
  now to cfn-changeset-viewer, look at flake.nix
    - using flake-parts to create our flake for us for multiple systems
    - output packages and devShells: has awscli2
    - can run `nix run github:trek10inc/cfn-changeset-viewer`
    - run nix build, look at result

  what about system configuration?
  system.nix topics
  flake.nix
    - darwinConfigurations and homeConfigurations for configuring nix-darwin or home-manager
  system/darwin.nix
    - all the way to the bottom, `darwinSystem`, look through modules
    - look at darwin-settings:
        enableSudoTouchId, finder settings, auto software update, dock settings, forceClick: false
    - homebrew/casks
    - homeManagerConfig - imports from home
  homeManagerConfig import ../home is also done by system/home-manager.nix

  home-manager/default.nix, lots of imports
  packages.nix
    - notice no node or python installed, they're installed in my projects instead
  git.nix
    - everything defined in nix
  what if you don't want to use nix? Home manager can manage arbitrary files
  awsume.nix:
    - saves a config.yml file somewhere
