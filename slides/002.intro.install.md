What is Nix?: Installing
===

## How can you install Nix?

Official Nix Installer: https://nixos.org/

It will have you confirm everything it does to the system. The big things are:

<!-- pause -->
- modify `/etc/zshrc`, `/etc/bashrc`, etc
  - loads nix hooks/sets nix paths
  - backups will be created
<!-- pause -->
- create a service for the Nix daemon
<!-- pause -->
- create a `/nix` volume - this is the "Nix Store"
<!-- pause -->
- create build users that are used by the daemon to perform builds
<!-- pause -->

```

<!--
speaker_note: |
  install with the official nix installer
  there are also third party installers with different defaults set
  the official one is fine for now
  the installer confirms everything it'll do

  =====

  modifies global shell login files to load nix hooks/environment variables

  =====

  creates a nix-daemon launch service

  =====

  creates `/nix/store` volume

  =====

  sets up the build users

  =====

  general flow is that the nix cli calls the daemon, which uses build users to write files to the store
  the daemon will also create symlinks to allow you to use the built software in the nix store
