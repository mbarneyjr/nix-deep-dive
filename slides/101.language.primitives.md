<!-- column: 0 -->

There are a few primitives:

| Primitive       | Example                                     |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------|
| string          | `"hello"` `''newline-capable string''`      |
|                 |                                             |
| integer         | `1`                                         |
|                 |                                             |
| float           | `3.141`                                     |
|                 |                                             |
| boolean         | `true`                                      |
|                 |                                             |
| path            | `./main.go`                                 |
|                 |                                             |
| null            | `null`                                      |
|                 |                                             |
| list            | `[ 1 "two" false ]`                         |
|                 |                                             |
| attribute set   | `{ a = "hello"; b = 2; }` `{ a.b.c = 1; }`  |
|                 |                                             |
| function        | `x: x + 1` `{ x, y }: x + y` `x: y: x + y`  |
|                 |                                             |

```nix
nix-repl> "hello"
"hello"

nix-repl> ''
  this is a multi
  line-string
''
"this is a multi\nline-string\n"

nix-repl> ./images/nix.png
/Users/.../nix.png

nix-repl> { a = 1; b = 2; }
{
  a = 1;
  b = 2;
}

nix-repl> { a.b.c = 1; }
{ a = { b = { c = 1; }; }; }
```

<!--
speaker_note: |
  nix has strings, and multi-line strings can be made with four single quotes
  it also has integers, floats, and booleans

  paths are special, they're not strings but an actual primitive representing a file

  null values are allowed
  lists look like other languages, except that the delimiter itself is whitespace
  lists do not have to be homogenous

  attribute sets are like dictionaries or maps in other languages
  they have keys and values, can be nested, and also do not have to be homogenous
  you can declare a nested attribute set with the dot operator, each key evaluates to another nested set

  functions are barebones, they only accept one argument which is declared before the colon
  the output of a function is the expression that comes after the colon
  writing functions that need to do something with multiple values can be done with attribute sets or currying
