Nix can install programs for you:

<!-- alignment: left -->

<!-- pause -->

<!-- column_layout: [1, 1] -->

<!-- column: 0 -->

```sh
$ nix profile install nixpkgs#neofetch
```

<!-- column: 1 -->

This installs to your user's Nix "profile".

<!-- pause -->

<!-- reset_layout -->

What's a profile?

<!-- alignment: left -->

<!-- pause -->

<!-- column_layout: [1, 1] -->

<!-- column: 0 -->

A profile is a series of symlinks stored in `~/.local/state/nix/profiles` and `~/.nix-profile`.

Profiles are versioned, each change creates a new "generation", and you can roll back profiles.

Tip: you can install from any flake!

```sh
$ nix profile install github:user/repo#flake
```

<!-- column: 1 -->

<!-- pause -->

```sh
$ echo $PATH
...:~/.nix-profile/bin:...

$ ls -al ~/.nix-profile
~/.nix-profile ->
        ~/.local/state/nix/profiles/profile

$ ls -al ~/.local/state/nix/profiles
profile -> profile-2-link
profile-1-link -> /nix/store/<hash>-profile
profile-2-link -> /nix/store/<hash>-profile
```

speaker_note: |
  nix can install things for you, like brew or apt
  note that the approach in this slide is for informational purposes
  it's not recommended to install packages this way, a better way will be in a future slide
  =====
  `nix profile install` will install packages to your nix profile
  =====
  what's a profile?
  =====
  they're really just a collection of symlinks to the nix store
  they're also versioned
  every time you change your profile, you create a new generation
  you can even roll back to previous generations
  =====
  if you inspect your profile, you can see the different generations of your profiles
