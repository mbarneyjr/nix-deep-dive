## Overview

<!-- column: 0 -->

Nix is a _functional_ programming language.
All nix expressions evaluate to a single value.
Returns are implicit.

Nix has a repl.

```sh
$ nix repl
Nix 2.24.14
Type :? for help.
nix-repl> "hello"
"hello"
```

You can also evaluate expressions inline or via a file.

```sh
nix eval --expr '"hello"'
```

language: nix

speaker_note: |
  Nix is a functional programming language

  the big thing is that the language is composed of expressions

  the last thing in a nix program is what the output of the program is

  return value is implicit

  there is a repl if you'd like to give it a try

  the literal string "hello" returns "hello" as its result

  the example on the right is what a more complex piece of nix code might look like
