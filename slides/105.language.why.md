Nix Language: Why?
===

<!-- pause -->

Most nix programs return a special primitive - a "derivation":

> A specification for running an executable
> on precisely defined input files
> to repeatably produce output files
> at uniquely determined file system paths.

Key points:

- derivations are just build recipes
- inputs are precise: changing inputs produces different build
- builds are reproducible
  - builds are sandboxed to minimize side-effects
  - builds are "pure"

Derivations are built and evaluated by the nix build tool and package manager.

  why write nix code?
  what do most nix programs do?

  =====

  the nix cli is built to interpret nix expressions when building software
  most nix programs are meant to return a special primitive called a "derivation"

  =====

  a derivation is really just a build recipe
  this build recipe has well-defined inputs, and just describes how to build the software
  the derivation inputs are used to define dependencies, source files, compilers, and other tools
  since builds are sandboxed, there's a high guarantee that the build will be reproducible
