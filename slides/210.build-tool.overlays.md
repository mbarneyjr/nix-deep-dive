Nix Build Tool: Overlays
===

What if you need a different version of a package?

Some packages are duplicated: `nodejs_20`, `nodejs_22`, but not all.

<!-- pause -->

Nixpkgs allows you to override derivation inputs, like the git tag that's built from.

For instance: `awsume` is in nixpkgs at version `4.5.3`, but what if I want to have `4.5.6.alpha`?

speaker_note: |
  overlays allow you to modify the build of a package
  a good use case is installing a later version of a package that isn't in nixpkgs yet
  for instance, what if I needed a different version of presenterm, or awsume?
  =====
  nixpkgs provides utilities on most of its packages to override derivation inputs
