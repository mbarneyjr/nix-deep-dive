Nix Build Tool: Lazy Evaluation and Caching
===

<!-- column_layout: [2, 1] -->

<!-- pause -->

`import <nixpkgs>` pulls in the nixpkgs repository, but Nix is lazily evaluated.

<!-- pause -->

Nixpkgs also has a binary cache that allows you to download pre-built packages.

<!-- pause -->

In this example, `nix-build` would only get the `hello` package, not everything in nixpkgs.
It wouldn't rebuild `hello` if it has already been built and published to Nix's cache.

-- _https://cache.nixos.org_

<!-- column: 1 -->

```nix
# declare the `hello` package from nixpkgs
let
  pkgs = import <nixpkgs>;
in
  pkgs.hello
```

<!--
speaker_note: |
  it's worth noting that nix is lazily evaluated
  =====
  when you `import <nixpkgs>`, you're importing the entirety of the nixpkgs repository
  but you're not downloading/building/installing everything from nixpkgs
  only the things that are referenced by your nix expressions are actually evaluated
  =====
  nixpkgs also utilizes a cache
  most things in nixpkgs have already been built and put into a binary cache
  so the nix client will download from the cache when it can
  =====
  in this example, we're only using `hello` from nixpkgs, so only that will be built or downloaded
